Respondents are defined as having a limiting long standing illness if they have any physical or mental health conditions or illnesses lasting or expected to last for 12 months or more, and the condition(s) or illness(es) reduce their ability to carry out day to day activities. The impairment types changed in 2012/13 therefore disability estimates are not directly comparable with those for years prior to 2012/13. Everyone classified as disabled under the FRS definition would also be classified as disabled under the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA). However, some individuals classified as disabled and having rights under the DDA would not be captured by this definition.\r\n\r\n[b]Section 75 category[/b]: Religious belief\r\n[b]Variable used[/b]: Religion\r\n[b]Breakdown available[/b]: Catholic; Protestant and other Christian religions\r\n\r\nReligion is based on the religion of the head of the benefit unit.

Options are: a. Heterosexual/ Straight, b. Gay/ Lesbian, c. Bisexual, d. Other.\r\n\r\nStraight or heterosexual is the only group with a large enough sample size. Due to small sample sizes, reliable estimates are not available for 'Gay/Lesbian', 'Bisexual' or 'Other'.\r\nData on Sexual Orientation is not available prior to 2011/12 as questions were not asked on the Family Resources Survey.\r\n\r\n[b]Section 75 category[/b]: Persons with dependants and persons without\r\n[b]Variable used[/b]: Dependants\r\n[b]Breakdown available[/b]: Has dependants (children only); Does not have dependants (children only)\r\n\r\nA 'Dependant' is an individual aged under 16.

One-off events of a particular local or national level occurring during, or close to the survey's fieldwork period may impact results and create volatility from year to year.\r\n\r\nTo account for sampling error, the data have been weighted by age, gender, and location, based on the most recently available Census data.\r\n\r\nIn 2020, the NILT survey was moved from an in-person interviewer-led survey to a combination of CAWI (Computer Assisted Web Interviewing) and CATI (Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing) - the new format has been used in every year since 2020.\r\n\r\nRespondents to this survey were asked: 'Would you describe yourself as very prejudiced against people of minority ethnic communities, a little prejudiced, or not prejudiced at all?' The figures reported are the proportions who selected 'very prejudiced' or 'a little prejudiced'.\r\n\r\nSome figures have been suppressed due to small sample sizes (less than 50 respondents), missing values are denoted as ‘..’ or a blank space depending on the format it is being viewed.\r\n\r\n[b]Section 75 category[/b]: Age\r\n[b]Variable used[/b]: Age\r\n[b]Breakdown available[/b]: 18-24; 25-44; 45-64; 65-74; 75+\r\n\r\n[b]Section 75 category[/b]: Men and Women generally\r\n[b]Variable used[/b]: Sex\r\n[b]Breakdown available[/b]: Male; Female\r\n\r\n[b]Section 75 category[/b]: Marital status\r\n[b]Variable used[/b]: Marital status \r\n[b]Breakdown available[/b]: Single (never married or never legally registered a civil partnership); Married or in a legally registered civil partnership; Other marital or civil partnership status\r\n\r\n[u]Other marital or civil partnership status includes[/u]: Married and separated from husband/wife; Divorced; Widowed; In a legally-recognised civil partnership and separated from civil partner; Formerly a civil partner, the civil partnership now legally dissolved; A surviving civil partner as partner has died.\r\n\r\n[b]Section 75 category[/b]: Disability\r\n[b]Variable used[/b]: Disability\r\n[b]Breakdown available[/b]: Disabled; Not Disabled\r\n\r\n‘Disability’ is measured using ‘limiting long-standing illness’.
